# Advent Of Code 2022 Edition

All code is done in Rust.<br>There's a directory for each day, and unit tests are available as well. <br>
In each challenge, there's an `input` directory with 2 input files, `input.txt` and `test_input.txt`.<br>the first is the file generated by the challenge, and the second is for unit testing purposes.
